Release Note 3.7 Dear Swiss-PdbViewer users,

We are glad to announce the availability of version 3.7, which 
corrects several glitches of the version 3.7b2.


We no longer have enough time to dedicate to answer directly to 
all questions that are sent to us. Therefore, please use the 
e-mail discussion list that was setup by Prof. Gale Rhode 
(check our web site to subscribe).
Although we will continue to read and consider all bug reports 
and requests for improvements that are directly sent to us, we 
are unlikely to answer those mails.

Have fun,
Nicolas, Torsten & Alexandre.

Comments about release 3.7 
- There is an updated version of the Manual on the main site.
- It is possible to use custom colors for amino acids
through the custom color menu. See an example file in your usrstuff
directoy.
- Better CCP4 Electron density map cross-platform support
(when computed on PC or linux can be read on Mac sgi)
- Rock and roll motion should be stopped using esc key.
- Fixed the add residue bug that was always adding an Ala regardless
of what was selected.
- Fixed a few bugs in the Pov-Ray scene creation.
- Better stereo red/blue rendering
- Fixed bugs in the scripting language and added support for 2D arrays.
Some of the examples present on the web site will no longer work correctly,
However, the examples provided with the distribution are functional (for
some of them, you may have to download specific files such as 1ATP or 4MDH
and place them in your 'download' directory).
The scripting language manual will be updated later directly on the Web site.
- reorganization of the Fit menu to provide better access to a
second exhaustive 3D-fit method.
- Added a few filetypes on the Mac. Files of type 'BINA' and '????'
can be open in addition to files of type 'TEXT'. This should help
Mac users read the files returned by Swiss-Model.

Finally, Mac users will be happy to know that I am debugging a
carbonized version that will lift the 256 colors limitation and
work on OSX. The port is complete, and I am currently testing
that the various dialogs and scripts run smoothly.
