# The following script does the same as the previous one
# except that it will write results for phi and psi in a file
# this shows how to do string concatenation, and conversion
# from floating point values to string.
# Then it will open the resulting file so that you see what has been done.


open pdb from download "1CRN.pdb";

$MYFILENAME = "results";
$MYFILE = open file $MYFILENAME in usrstuff for writing; 
$X = 0;
$NBGROUPS = groupcount of "1crn";
do
{
	$SEL = select in "1crn" pos $X;
	$PHI = phi($SEL);
	$PSI = psi($SEL);
	print on $MYFILE "phi = " + (string)$PHI + " psi = " + (string)$PSI;
} while (++$X < $NBGROUPS);
close file $MYFILE;
open text $MYFILENAME in usrstuff;

thank you
