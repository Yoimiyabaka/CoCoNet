DESCRIPTION
===========

Swiss-PdbViewer is an application that provides a user friendly
interface allowing to analyse several proteins at the same time.
The proteins can be superimposed in order to deduce structural 
alignments and compare their active sites or any other relevant 
parts. Amino acid mutations, H-bonds, angles and distances between
atoms are easy to obtain thanks to the intuitive graphic and menu
interface. 

Moreover, Swiss-PdbViewer is tightly linked to Swiss-Model, an 
automated homology modelling server accessible from ExPASy

Working with these two programs greatly reduces the amount of 
work necessary to generate models, as it is possible to thread
a protein primary sequence onto a 3D template and get an immediate
feedback of how well the threaded protein will be accepted by the
reference structure before submitting a request to build missing 
loops and refine sidechain packing.

NOTE for Win NT:
----------------
SPDBV is writing temporary files while running. Please make
sure, that the installation directory  (e.g. C:\spdbv) and 
all subdirectories have the correct Read/Write permissions
for all users working with this installation.
